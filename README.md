# ASDF
Codebase supporting "An automatic snow detection framework from repeat digital photography".
The automatic snow detection framework (ASDF) aims to estimate the fractional snow cover (FSC) from repeat digital photography for plant functional types (PFTs). ASDF provides a fully automatic processing flow without manually labeled samples, which makes ASDF much more convenient for numerous repeat digital images. The framework uses machine learning to obtain adjustable classification criteria automatically rather than using constant thresholds, resulting in a pixel-level classification for images. The ASDF was designed based on PhenoCam Network images and has been modeled and tested in 6 PFTs, including agriculture, grassland, tundra, shrub, deciduous broadleaf, and evergreen needleleaf. It has higher accuracy than previous unsupervised methods, especially for vegetation with complex surfaces.
